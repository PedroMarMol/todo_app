# To-Do App

This web application allows you to have a list of todos assigned to your user.

The technologies I have used are:

- The app is made in React, making use of its reusable components and custom hooks.

- Context to make the parent component provide data to the other components, in this app the data is the user and some functions that create one, log in or out of the users database.

- Firebase Auth for user access and Cloud Firestore to store the list items of every user. I had never used Firebase services before, its documentation is really good and easy to integrate.
